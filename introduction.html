        <p>
            I’m an undergraduate Senior at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte studying Computer Science majoring in Human and Computer Interaction. 
            I believe this course will be insightful on the fundamentals of front end development.
            I understand that what I put here is publicly available on the web and I won’t put anything here I don’t want the public to see - WZJ - 1/12/2026.

            <li><strong>Personal Background:</strong> I transferred to UNC Charlotte in 2024 with an associate degree and I’ve been developing small games during game jams and personal passion projects.</li>
            <li><strong>Professional Background:</strong> I haven’t worked professionally in my field yet, but I am creating an Indie Studio this year to promote projects that I’m developing.</li>

            <li><strong>Background in Subject:</strong> The majority of my experience in Web development are projects I’ve done on campus and some classes I’ve taken in middle school. I know a little about HTML from the project so hopefully I can use my previous experience in this class.</li>
            <li><strong>Primary Work Computer &amp; Location:</strong> I use my own laptop and I go to the Library on campus and Valvela cafe to focus on assignments.</li>
